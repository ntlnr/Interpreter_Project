# Interpreter_Project
The final project for CS4450 of Team Emmm

By using the interpreter, the user can interpret a lot of python files. It implement if/else blocks, variable definitions, and arithmetic operators, and assignment operators, etc.

## There are two files in the main branch
### The TOKEN_GETER.py will generate TOKEN stream, and Interpreter.py will interpret it.
TOKEN_GETER.py file is able to generate TOKEN stream and identify a banch of keywords like int, str, add, substract. 

Then Interpreter.py file can interpret the TOEKN stream, and can do different operations on different TOEKN stream.
> Other branches have a python file that can be used as a reference for this project
